Viewing and Using a Scan
------------------------

Once you have run a scan, you can view the scan details. 

To view the scans, go to the ``Re-platform`` tab on the ``Migrations`` page.  All the scans are listed by name. If you have run the same scan with the same name, it will appear as Scan <number>.
