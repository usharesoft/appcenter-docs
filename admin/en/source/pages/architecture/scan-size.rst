Estimating Scan Size
====================

It is difficult to estimate sizing of scans. However, the following guidelines may be useful to plan your first scan:

	average scan size x number of scans

Scan sizes vary from 100 KB to 12 GB

You should note that the data that will be scanned does not include operating systems known by UForge. For example, Debian or other OS data will not be included in the scan size. 

Also, if you have already run a scan, only the delta information will be included.
