Listing Appliance Templates
---------------------------

To view the appliance templates you have access, go to the ``Apps`` tab in the user interface.  By default the appliance templates are listed by latest first.

Under the ``Appliance Library``, the appliances are organized as follows:

	* ``Created Appliances`` are appliance templates you created
	* ``Imported Appliances`` have been imported from a Collaboration workspace or from the UForge Marketplace if you have access to one 
	* ``Shared Appliances`` are appliance templates that you have shared to a Collaboration workspace or to the UForge Marketplace if you have access
