Hammr is a lightweight client-side tool based on Python, and can be installed on all major operating systems.

Hammr can be used as part of your “DevOps tool chain” and in conjunction with other tools such as Jenkins, Chef, Puppet and SaltStack, allowing you to easily build your machine images and maintain your live running instances.  Hammr also has migration capabilities, allowing you to scan a live system, generate a machine image for a different environment as well as export it back to a configuration file for sharing.
