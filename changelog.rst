* Added the ability to reset a user's password via the UForge CLI (``--resetPassword`` option).


Compatibility Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Migrating to UForge 3.7-2 will have the following compatibility issues:

* any Windows golden image that use a non-standard Edition (for example ``Windows K5`` instead of the official ``Standard``, ``Enterprise``, ``Webserver`` or ``Database``) will be changed to ``Standard`` edition. A warning will be added to the log files. If you would like to change the Edition of the golden image, you should re-register the golden image with ``org golden create`` command.

.. warning:: Fujitsu is not legally responsible for any damage or loss caused by the possible inconsistency between the assumed and the actual Editions.

The following API interface and calls have been modified:

* The object ``DistribProfile`` is now an abstract object and is implemented by either :ref:`linuxProfile-object` or :ref:`windowsProfile-object` (which are new object types).
* The deprecated object ``DistribProfileTemplate`` has now been deleted.  The object :ref:`distribProfile-object` is now used.  The attribute ``standardProfileUri`` is now deprecated and been set to ``null``.

Due to the above object changes, the following API calls have been modified:

	* :ref:`orgOSWindows-add`
	* :ref:`orgOSWindows-delete`
	* :ref:`osTemplate-getAll`
	* :ref:`osTemplate-get`
	* :ref:`orgOSWindows-getAll`

The following API calls have been added to enhance scanned Windows-based workloads:

	* :ref:`workspaceTemplateOSApplications-get`
	* :ref:`workspaceTemplateOSServices-get`
	* :ref:`workspaceTemplateOSPartitionTable-get`
