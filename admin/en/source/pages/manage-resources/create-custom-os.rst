Creating Custom OS Profiles with UI
-----------------------------------

UForge provides a set of OS profiles. If you want to create another OS profile, you can create one using UForge's graphical user interface.

To create a new OS profile:

	#. Under the ``Administration`` tab go to the ``Distributions`` tab.
	#. Click on the operating system.  This will provide the current list of profiles this operating system has.
