==============

Describes the installation profile of an appliance template. The installation profile holds configuration information that should be applied as part of the installation of an operating system. This includes partitioning table layout, root password information, kernel parameters, keyboard settings, timezone etc.

Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~

The list of attributes for ``installProfile`` are:

	* ``activationKey`` (string): the activation key of the Windows operating system
	* ``applianceUri`` (anyURI): the uri resource of the appliance template this install profile belongs to
	* ``diskSize`` (long): the disk size (in bytes). .. note:: this is only used for ``basic partitioning`` with one disk
	* ``firewallAuto`` (boolean): boolean to determine whether the firewall settings are automatically set, if false this question is asked to the user interactively when provisioning an instance
	* ``firewallEnabled`` (boolean): boolean to determine if the firewall is enabled (only used if ``firewallAuto = true``)

	* ``hwType`` (string): the recommended hardware type (used for VMware type machine images)
	* ``internetSettingsAuto`` (boolean): boolean to determine whether the internet settings are automatically set, if false this question is asked to the user interactively when provisioning an instance
	* ``kernelParameters`` (string): the list of kernel parameters to use (this is one string with each kernel parameter separated by a comma
	* ``keyboard``: the keyboard setting (only used if ``keyboardAuto = true``)
	* ``keyboardAuto`` (boolean): boolean to determine whether the keyboard settings are automatically set, if false this question is asked to the user interactively when provisioning an instance

	* ``nics``: the list of NICs to configure (see :ref:`nic-object`)
	* ``nicsUri`` (anyURI): the uri resource to get the list of NIC information

	* ``runSysprep`` (boolean): boolean to determine if sysprep will be executed for Windows operating system
	* ``skipLicenses`` (boolean): a boolean to determine whether to display and enforce the user to accept licensing information during the provisioning of an instance. if ``true`` no licensing information is displayed
	* ``swapSize`` (long): the swap size (in bytes). .. note:: this is only used for ``basic partitioning`` with one disk
