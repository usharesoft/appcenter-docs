Allowing Access to Image Formats
--------------------------------

Image formats can be managed at the level of the organization or of the user.

An administrator who wants to add format rights to several users within an organization should create the formats at the level of the organization and then add them to a subscription profile. In this case, all new users created with the given subscription profile will have access to the formats. 

In order to add a format you must create a target format and target platform. 

.. note:: Without a target platform, the image cannot be published. 

The administrator can add or remove image formats for a specific user account using the command-line interface, as described in :ref:`set-formats-user`.

.. _listing-formats:

Listing Formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In UForge AppCenter, in order for a user to use a given format, a Target Format must be created and enabled for the given user and organization. Moreover, if the user wants to use a given Target Format for publishing an image, then a Target Platform must also be created, enabled and associated to the Target Format.

.. note:: As Target Platforms and Target Formats are created at the org level but then must be enabled for a given user, the list of available formats can differ for users of the same organization. 

In order to list the formats available for a given `org`, use the command ``org targetformat list``.

In order to list the formats available for a given `user`, use the command ``user targetformat list``.

.. _formats-org:

Adding Formats to an Organization Using the CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add access to a format to an organization, you must:

	1. Create a target format category using  ``uforge org category create``
	2. Create target format using  ``uforge org targetformat create``
	3. If the target format type is Cloud, create a target platform using ``uforge org targetplatform create``. This target platform is necessary to publish image generated with the target format. The target platform must have a cloud account associated.
	4. If the target format type is Cloud, add the target format to the target platform using  ``uforge org targetplatform addTargetFormat``.
	5. (Optional) Add the format to a subscription profile using  ``uforge subscription targetFormat add``. To add a target platform use either: 

		* ``uforge subscription targetformat add``
		* ``uforge subscription targetplatform add``

	.. note:: In order to apply the changes to all users (even those already created), use the option ``--allusers``. For example: 

	.. code-block:: shell

		$ uforge subscription targetformat add --targetformat ovf qcow2 vbox --allusers --name sub --url https://uforge.usharesoft.com:443 -u $ADMIN -p $PASS

	6. Enable the target format for the organization using  ``uforge org targetformat enable``.
	7. Enable the target format using ``user targetformat enable``.

Once the format is created in an organisation, you can either:

	* add it to a group of users by adding it to the subscription profile (refer to :ref:`formats-subscription`)
	* add it to an individual user (refer to :ref:`set-formats-user`)

Adding Image Formats from the GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create your own image formats from the UForge GUI. To do so:

	1. Create a target platform.
	2. Create a target format.

Opening Ports for Publication to Specific Formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the target format your users will have access to, you may have to open specific ports.

`VCenter`

Publishing to VMWare VCenter has the following workflow. If your users will publish to VCenter, you should open port 443 in HTTPS.
