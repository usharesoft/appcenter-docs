Generate a Machine Image
------------------------

Once you have scanned a source system, you can generate a machine image directly from the scan report.

.. note:: When generating a machine image, some services are disabled or enabled depending on the target machine image being created (refer to :ref:`service-state`).

To create an image from a scan:

	1. Go to the ``Scans`` tab.
	2. Click on the scan to view details.
	3. Click on the ``generate`` icon in the top right.

	.. image:: /images/scan-generate-image2.png

	4. Select the image format you want.
	5. Click ``Generate``.
	6. You can view the progress and the completed generation on the ``Dashboard`` tab under ``Generations``.
