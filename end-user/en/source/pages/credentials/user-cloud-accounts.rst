	2. Go to ``Cloud Account``.
	3. Select the type of account you want to create from the ``Add account`` drop-down menu at the top right.

	4. Scroll over any given field for more information on the mandatory information to provide for a given cloud account.

	.. note:: In order to set up the credentials for a Microsoft Azure account, there are a number of steps you must complete first. For more information refer to :ref:`azure-account`.

	5. Click ``Create`` to complete.

.. _azure-account:

Setting up a Microsoft Azure Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to publish images to Microsoft Azure, you must first set up the correct Microsoft Azure credentials in UForge. To do so, first, from your Microsoft Azure account you will need to:

	1. Create an Azure Active Directory application (as described in the `official Microsoft Azure documentation related to Azure Active Directory creation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal#create-an-azure-active-directory-application>`_).
	2. Get the subscription ID from your Microsoft Azure account.
	3. Get the application ID and authentication key (as described in `official Microsoft Azure documentation related to application ID and authentication key <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal#get-application-id-and-authentication-key>`_).
	4. Retrieve the tenant ID which you will need to enter in UForge credentials (as described in `official Microsoft Azure documentation related to tenant ID retrieval <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal#get-tenant-id>`_). 
	5. Assign the ``contributor`` role to the application (as described in `official Microsoft Azure documentation related to application role assignation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal#assign-application-to-role>`_).

Then you will need to fill in your credential information in UForge. To do so:

	1. Go to the ``Credentials`` tab in the left-hand sidebar.
	2. Go to ``Cloud Account``.
	3. Select ``Microsoft Azure`` from the ``Add account`` drop-down menu at the top right.

.. _windows-aws-s3:

Setting up an AWS Account to Publish Windows Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Before publishing a Windows image to AWS, ``vmimport`` role must be properly assigned to an AWS account. An access right to S3 bucket is also required for an account. Refer to the procedure in `VM Import Service Role section of the AWS documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-image-import.html>`_. Because the name of a S3 bucket changes for each image publish, you should give access to any buckets using a wildcard `*`.

The following is an example of ``role-policy.json``:

	.. code-block:: json

		{
		   "Version":"2012-10-17",
		   "Statement":[
		      {
		         "Effect":"Allow",
		         "Action":[
		            "s3:GetBucketLocation",
		            "s3:GetObject",
		            "s3:ListBucket" 
		         ],
		         "Resource":[
		            "arn:aws:s3:::*"
		         ]
		      },
		      {
		         "Effect":"Allow",
		         "Action":[
		            "ec2:ModifySnapshotAttribute",
		            "ec2:CopySnapshot",
		            "ec2:RegisterImage",
		            "ec2:Describe*"
		         ],
		         "Resource":"*"
		      }
		   ]
		}
