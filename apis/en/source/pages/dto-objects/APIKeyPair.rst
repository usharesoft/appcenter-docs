apiKeyPair
==========

Holds the key pair information used as an alternative way to using basic authorization for HTTP requests.

The public key is inserted as a query in the request URI. The secret key is then used to encode the entire URI to create a signature using HMAC_SHA1. This signature is then added to the end of the request URI.

These keys are created automatically by the platform. For more information, refer to :ref:`apikey-api-resources`.
