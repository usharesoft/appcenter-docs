softwareBundleExport
====================

Holds tracking information on requests to export a software bundle. An export basically archives the software bundle meta-data and all relevant files and allows the user to download that archive. The archive information can then be version controlled or imported to another UForge platform.

The software bundle export is an asynchronous job which may take some time. The current status of the export is stored in this object.
