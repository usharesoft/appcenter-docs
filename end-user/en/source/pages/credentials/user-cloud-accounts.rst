Setting up a Microsoft Azure Resource Manager Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to publish images to Microsoft ARM, you must first set up the correct Azure ARM credentials in UForge. To do so, first, from your Microsoft Azure account you will need to:

	1. Create an Azure Active Directory application (as described in the `official Microsoft Azure documentation related to Azure Active Directory creation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal#create-an-azure-active-directory-application>`_).
	2. Get the subscription ID from your Microsoft Azure account.
	3. Get the application ID and authentication key (as described in `official Microsoft Azure documentation related to application ID and authentication key <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal#get-application-id-and-authentication-key>`_).
	4. Retrieve the tenant ID which you will need to enter in UForge credentials (as described in `official Microsoft Azure documentation related to tenant ID retrieval <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal#get-tenant-id>`_). 
	5. Assign the ``contributor`` role to the application (as described in `official Microsoft Azure documentation related to application role assignation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal#assign-application-to-role>`_).

Then you will need to fill in your credential information in UForge. To do so:

	1. Go to the ``Credentials`` tab in the left-hand sidebar.
	2. Go to ``Cloud Account``.
	3. Select the ``Microsoft Azure Resource Manager`` from the ``Add account`` drop-down menu at the top right.
