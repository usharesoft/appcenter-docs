Migrating Live Workloads
========================

UForge AppCenter offers the capability to migrate a live system using two different methods:

* using ``Scans``. In this case there are three steps to migration: scan, generate and publish. Each step is done seperately by the user. When using scan to migrate, you can modify the appliance prior to the final migration.
* using ``Migration``. This automated process is only possible for Linux and certain target platforms.

In both cases, UForge will "deep scan" a live system and report back the meta-data of every file and package that makes up the running workload.

The following sub-sections describe in detail the different steps, requirements and limitations of ``Scans`` and ``Migrations``:
